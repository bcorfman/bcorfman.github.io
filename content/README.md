*"It is our job to create computer technology such that nobody has to program ... The programming language is human." - from an interview with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.*

So, how close are we to this reality? I've got some ideas for mid-sized software projects, including challenging ones that need a creative mix of graphics and sound. I'm curious -- could AI help me build these while I act as project manager? I'm blogging about it because while people are testing AI, I haven't seen many document their approach and thought process as they build something complex. Can the right prompts and guidance get an AI to make decent -- maybe even good -- software? I'll start small and see how far I can push my idea. Also, I'd love to hear from other creators about better ways to do this or if I'm on the right track.
