      <description>&amp;ldquo;It is our job to create computer technology such that nobody has to program. And that the programming language is human.&amp;rdquo; - from an interview with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.&#xA;So, how close are we to this reality? I&amp;rsquo;ve got some ideas for mid-sized software projects, including challenging ones that need graphics and sound. I&amp;rsquo;m curious - could AI help me build these while I act as project manager? I&amp;rsquo;m blogging about it because while people are testing AI, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many document their approach and thought process as they build something complex.</description>
