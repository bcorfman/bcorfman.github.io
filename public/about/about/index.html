<p>&ldquo;It is our job to create computer technology such that nobody has to program. And that the programming language is human.&rdquo; - NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang from an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEd-LqBCONg" target="_blank">captured here</a>.</p>
<p>How true is this <em>right now</em>? Is this type of artificial intelligence still being developed? I&rsquo;m a computer scientist and a software developer, and I really enjoy writing code, but I also have limited time in my life. On the other hand I&rsquo;m an ambitious guy, and I have several ideas for medium-sized software projects that I&rsquo;d like to accomplish. Some of these projects are also more than just code, and they require all sorts of additional sound and graphics assets. What if AI (or a team of AIs) could help me write these projects while I act as a team lead? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to find out. I&rsquo;m blogging my investigation because I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone really document this kind of research &hellip; working on an increasingly complex set of creative tasks that one or several developers or asset builders perform, but that I&rsquo;m asking a Large Language Model (LLM) to do instead. I&rsquo;m about to find out if the right amount of prompt engineering and directed tasks can result in decent software applications. I&rsquo;ll start small and work my way up to see if and where the technology breaks. I&rsquo;ll also be looking for comments from other developers to see if there are better methods than the ones I&rsquo;m using, or if I&rsquo;m on a path to success.</p>
